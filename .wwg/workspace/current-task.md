# Current Task

Status: READY FOR REVIEW

## Task Summary

- Task mode: Mixed docs/config/runtime drift repair after Existing Project Adoption
- Existing Project Adoption context:
  - This repo was adopted into WWG from existing code/docs/config.
  - Code/docs/config remain evidence of operational reality.
  - Inferred or stale adoption truth must stay labeled and reconciled instead of silently overwritten.
- User request:
  - Make the `bnpi-hris.tech` named Cloudflare Tunnel the first-class public path.
  - Remove normal TryCloudflare usage from Project Truth, VM login, SSH login, visual proof, image/bootstrap, and WWG truth surfaces.
  - Clarify whether SSH can be accessed through the domain.
  - Clarify how fresh/final images work on another device.

## Current Decision

- Current tunnel bootstrap ownership: host-managed on the Windows host.
- Current proof VM also has a VM-managed connector active after deliberate root-only credential import.
- Preferred BNPI remote-admin journey is VM-managed Cloudflare Tunnel plus
  browser-rendered SSH at `https://ssh.bnpi-hris.tech`; the BNPI Windows Server
  should remain Hyper-V-only with no inbound ports, no Windows SSH setup, and no
  `.ssh/config` dependency.
- Canonical startup/repair command:

```powershell
.\scripts\project-truth.ps1 ensure-bnpi-cloudflare-host -ProvisionDns -StartTunnel -VerifyPublic
```

- Fresh/final images must not contain Cloudflare tunnel credentials.
- TryCloudflare is disabled by default and remains only a deprecated manual proof tool.
- Public SSH through `ssh.bnpi-hris.tech` is verified through Cloudflare Access and the host-managed named tunnel.
- Public SSH through `ssh.bnpi-hris.tech` is also verified through the VM-side connector using `ssh://localhost:22`.
- Browser-rendered SSH is the desired clean journey for unprepared office or
  remote PCs; it still needs Cloudflare Access browser-rendering proof after the
  Zero Trust application setting is enabled.
- V6 packaging should preserve the V2 one-click extracted-zip shape: a small
  zip with a double-click `.cmd`, public bucket VHDX download, SHA-256
  verification, Hyper-V import/start, visible log window, and then V6 runtime
  proof. The Cloudflare tunnel credential must come from ProgramData at runtime,
  not from the zip, bucket image, repo, or baked VM.
- V7 is the current public package lane. It promotes the known clean V5 base
  image into `hyperv/v7/latest`, then keeps the V6 runtime proof/import path so
  the latest scripts, Cloudflare VM connector setup, and public checks run after
  import. The live proof VM disk was not published because it has contained
  root-only Cloudflare runtime credentials.
- Client/local VHDX retention is intentional: the host/client live VHDX may
  differ from the reusable public image and must not be overwritten or promoted
  by default. If a host-side or in-VM retained copy is needed, create it as a
  separate retained artifact with hash/manifest evidence, while keeping the
  clean public V7 package lane separate from any credential-bearing or
  client-specific disk.
- Current V6 proof serves public/LAN HRIS through healthy Docker Compose
  containers and VM-side Cloudflare. K3s/Argo still needs follow-up because many
  pods remain Pending/Evicted under memory pressure even when Argo Applications
  summarize as Synced/Healthy.
- 2026-07-01 incident correction: the current public HRIS path for PROD, UAT,
  and DEV is Docker Compose app/API containers behind the `bnpi-hris` named
  Cloudflare Tunnel. Do not treat K3s HRIS pods as the active public serving
  path until K3s/Argo is deliberately re-enabled and proven end-to-end.
- 2026-07-01 incident correction: K3s HRIS deployments/statefulsets are paused
  at zero replicas for DEV/UAT/PROD to avoid runtime contention while Docker
  Compose serves public HRIS. PVCs and data were not deleted.
- 2026-07-01 incident correction: public browser traffic must not call
  `https://*.bnpi-hris.tech:3001`. The working public pattern is same-origin
  `/api` through the app proxy/tunnel for app hostnames, with API hostnames
  available for direct health and API checks.

## Validation Notes

- LAN SSH and LAN HRIS endpoints passed.
- Public app/API/dev/uat/Grafana checks passed after connector warmup.
- CORS preflight returned HTTP 204.
- Wrong-password auth probe returned HTTP 401.
- `ssh.bnpi-hris.tech` DNS route and tunnel ingress were provisioned; LAN SSH passed; after Cloudflare Access policy allowed `1bis.solutions.tech@gmail.com`, SSH through `cloudflared access ssh --hostname %h` returned `SSH_ACCESS_OK`.
- On 2026-06-29, the named tunnel credential was imported into the proof VM as root-only runtime state, `cloudflared-bnpi-hris.service` was enabled and active, `cloudflared tunnel info bnpi-hris` showed a `linux_amd64` connector, and SSH through `ssh.bnpi-hris.tech` returned `SSH_DOMAIN_OK`.
- On 2026-06-30, V6 one-shot proof passed LAN PROD/DEV/UAT app/API health,
  public PROD/DEV/UAT app/API/Grafana health, public CORS, VM-side Cloudflare
  ingress validation, and CLI SSH through `ssh.bnpi-hris.tech`.
- On 2026-06-30, a V2-style V6 one-click zip was generated and uploaded as a
  tiny package under `hyperv/v6/latest`; public URL checks returned HTTP 200 for
  the zip, installer script, README, and manifest. The package contains no VHDX
  and no Cloudflare credential.
- On 2026-06-30, V7 was published under `hyperv/v7/latest`: GCS metadata showed
  the VHDX at `75635884032` bytes, all V7 sidecar and installer URLs returned
  HTTP 200, the downloaded public V7 zip matched SHA-256
  `4534136199EEBA85FFAFBF08C8EAFEEDA1BBC784D9F4D3A269F30D9F95D75088`, and a
  V7 installer dry run targeted the V7 VHDX/manifest paths while preserving the
  runtime-only Cloudflare credential import.
- On 2026-07-01, PROD and UAT app containers were recreated from
  `hris-app-local:develop` image
  `sha256:fa41efd235cbb372b7b9c2cd631081d8f7a6738af464b7ca67a0dcf47cdd83c5`.
  Browser verification for `https://bnpi-hris.tech/` loaded the HR login screen,
  requested `https://bnpi-hris.tech/api/system-provisioning/status` with HTTP
  200, and showed no public `:3001` browser request.
- On 2026-07-01, DEV Docker Compose API/app containers were restored without
  rebuilding or touching the DEV Postgres volume. VM origin checks passed:
  `http://localhost:3100/auth/login` HTTP 200,
  `http://localhost:3100/api/auth/me` HTTP 401, and
  `http://localhost:3101/health` HTTP 200. Browser verification for
  `https://dev.bnpi-hris.tech/` loaded the HR login screen, requested
  `https://dev.bnpi-hris.tech/api/system-provisioning/status` with HTTP 200,
  and showed no public `:3001` browser request.
- Earlier on 2026-07-02, `10.184.38.138` no longer answered SSH or HRIS port
  probes from the Windows host. The VM was temporarily reached through DHCP
  address `10.184.38.144`, and host-managed `cloudflared-bnpi-hris.yml` was
  temporarily corrected to that DHCP address. This was superseded by stable
  secondary address `10.184.37.19`.
- Public verification from the client LAN is currently blocked by network
  policy: plain HTTP returns a company-policy block page and HTTPS resets
  during TLS for `bnpi-hris.tech` hostnames, while general Cloudflare/Google
  HTTPS works.
- On 2026-07-03, after the DHCP drift follow-up, the VM was hard-cut over to
  pure static LAN addressing on `eth0`: `10.184.37.78/24` for K3s node/API
  identity and `10.184.37.19/24` for preferred operator/LAN access. DHCP is
  disabled, the default route is static via `10.184.38.254`, and SSH plus HRIS
  API health passed on both static addresses.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- `wwg test-check --format plain` passes after the stable `10.184.37.19`
  runtime/config drift repair because the Cloudflare config regression guard was
  updated with the active SSH origin.
- `wwg validate` passes after the stable LAN target drift repair.

## Follow-Up Needed

- Decide whether VM-managed Cloudflare should become the canonical fresh-import path; this requires an explicit secure credential handoff procedure and must not bake credentials into images.
- Define the retained-client-VHDX artifact flow: host export/copy remains the
  reliable Hyper-V artifact, and any in-VM copy should be secondary evidence or
  staging only unless proven bootable/importable from Windows Hyper-V.
- Keep Cloudflare Access SSH policy in the `933c5547e32839d664d155ce8a7424d5` Zero Trust account aligned with the allowed operator email.
- Enable and verify browser-rendered SSH for `https://ssh.bnpi-hris.tech` so
  remote admins can access the VM from unprepared browsers without configuring
  BNPI Windows host SSH or per-PC `.ssh/config`.
- Reconcile whether Docker Compose is the intended serving runtime for this V6
  appliance profile or tune K3s memory/capacity until Argo/K3s health matches
  the actually served HRIS app/API.
- Resolve existing WWG generated-report validation findings before release/commit claims that require a fully green WWG gate.
